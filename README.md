# board-game
This is a simple implementation of the classic game of Tic Tac Toe using Python. The game is played on a 3x3 board, and the goal is to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before your opponent does.

Getting Started
To run the game, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website here.

Once you have Python installed, you can download the tic_tac_toe.py file from this repository to your local machine. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.

To start the game, simply run the following command:

Copy code
python tic_tac_toe.py
The game will start and you'll be prompted to enter your moves by specifying the row and column numbers of the square you want to mark.

Game Rules
The game is played on a 3x3 board. Players take turns marking a square on the board with their symbol (either "X" or "O"). The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.

Project Structure
The tic_tac_toe.py file contains the entire game logic. The game is implemented using four functions:

print_board prints the current state of the board to the console.
check_win checks if a player has won the game.
tic_tac_toe is the main game loop that handles user input and updates the board.
Finally, the tic_tac_toe function is called to start the game.
The code is well-commented and easy to follow, so feel free to read through it and understand how the game works.

Customization
The game can be easily customized and extended to add new features or game modes. For example, you could add a feature that allows players to choose their symbols ("X" or "O"), or you could modify the game to be played on a larger board. The code is open-source and licensed under the MIT License, so feel free to use and modify it as you like.
